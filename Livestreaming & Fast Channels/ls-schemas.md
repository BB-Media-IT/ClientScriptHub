# Livestreaming & Fast Channels

This document details the schemas used to manage the data for the `Livestreaming & Fast Channels` product. During the delivery process, a specific S3 Bucket is generated for each client. In each of these buckets, we have three main folders that contain 
JSONL format files. These folders are organized as follows: `channels`, `contents`, `schedule` and `sports`. Additionally, within each of these main folders, there is a subfolder called `latest`, where the latest snapshot from each streaming platform surveyed and 
contracted by the client is stored.

## Document Structure
This document is organized into the following sections:

- [**File Description**](#file-description)
- [**Table Visualization & Data Relationships**](#table-visualization--data-relationships)

## Details of the S3 Buckets
Each client receives an S3 Bucket where data is organized into specific folders to ensure efficient management and quick access. The folder names reflect the types of data they contain, facilitating the identification and specific processing of each data set:

#### Example: 
- `s3://bucket-client/LiveStreaming/channels`
- `s3://bucket-client/LiveStreaming/contents`
- `s3://bucket-client/LiveStreaming/schedule`
- `s3://bucket-client/LiveStreaming/sports`

This folder contains a `latest` subfolder, which is periodically updated with the latest available snapshot, ensuring that customers always have access to the latest information.

#### Update frequency and scope
- The update of the data in S3 Bucket is defined according to the needs of each customer.
- The scope is defined according to the needs of each customer.

ðŸš€ You can get a weekly updated demo by connecting to the following Bucket `s3://bb-media-data/live-streaming/` using AWS CLI or any software and the endpoint parameter `--endpoint https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`.

>**Command example** `aws s3 --endpoint https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com cp s3://bb-media-data/live-streaming/ /Demo/BB-Media --recursive`

## File Description
We provide a detailed description of the files contained in the `Sources` folder, explaining the structure and type of data handled by each one. If you wish to see the schemas in YAML, [click here](schemas-yml).
